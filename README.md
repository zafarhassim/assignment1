This assignment takes a CSV file from Spotify and sorts it by the number of times the artist occurs and alphabetically. A 2D array was used to organize the amount of times that the artist occurs; by using a few parallel arrays. To alphabetize the list, the array copy was temporarily converted to the collections-based array. It was then sorted into reverse alphabetical order. It was then placed into a linked list. Here the insert function enabled a first in first out mechanism.
